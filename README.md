App link: tinder-clone-c3396.firebaseapp.com

This is a basic Tinder Clone.
I use React for frontend.Node.js , Express and MongoDB for backend. Photos are added by post request from Postman.
If you can't see photos just wait for a few seconds.
The first page is home page if you click chatIcon on the top right then you will be in the second page which is chatList page.
Now you can click to the name that who you want to be chatting with. In the personal chat there is no funcunalitty. Hope you enjoy!
